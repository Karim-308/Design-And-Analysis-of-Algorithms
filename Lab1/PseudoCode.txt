function main():
    Initialize an array nums containing numbers from 1 to 9.
    Initialize an empty array square to represent the 3x3 grid of the magic square.
    Initialize an array used to keep track of which numbers have been used in the permutation process.

    Call the permutation function with nums, square, used, and index set to 0.

function permutation(nums, square, used, index):
    if index is equal to 9: // If all cells are filled
        Check if the square is a magic square.
        If it is a magic square, print the square.
        Return.

    Loop through each number in nums:
        If the number has not been used:
            Place the number in the current cell of the square.
            Mark the number as used.
            Recursively call permutation with updated parameters for the next cell.
            Mark the number as unused (backtrack).

function isMagicSquare(square):
    Calculate the magic sum (sum of each row, column, and diagonal).
    Check if each row and column sum equals the magic sum.
    Check if the main diagonal and anti-diagonal sum equals the magic sum.
    If all sums are equal, return true indicating a magic square, otherwise return false.

function printMagicSquare(square):
    Print the square to display the magic square.
